                        <h3>Pre-departure research</h3>
                        <p>Over the last decade, the healthcare industry has undergone significant technological change. It
                            is important that as we expand our understanding of the sector, we also continue to innovate on
                            technologies that enable patient-centricity.</p>
                        <div class="full-content" style="display: none;">
                            <p>
                                By enabling patient-centricity
                                we ensure that we're not only solving complex challenges but also maintaining quality of
                                life and
                                monitoring to predict any poor outcomes. This first post addresses some of the innovative
                                technologies, and programs that facilitate them, coming out of Singapore in recent years.

                                Focusing on a specific industry, I can outline how the Singaporean government allocates
                                resources to bring health startup technology to life. For example, the Ministry of Health
                                has worked in collaboration with National University of Singapore startup T-Rehab to develop
                                the latest innovation in the physiotherapy industry - Smart Health TeleRehab. TeleRehab is
                                remote physiotherapy and it’s an interesting interplay of technology. It utilizes sensors,
                                digital dashboards, video conferencing, and more to transform a physical form of therapy
                                into a virtual space.

                                Health technology like this shakes up an industry with so much potential. I’m looking
                                forward to exploring all the other initiatives, products, and services offered.

                        <h3>Site Visits</h3>
                        <p>On our first site visit, we went to The Peranakan Museum, located in the museum district of
                            Singapore. This was a particularly interesting exploration of the country's Peranakan culture,
                            which I had never learned about before.</p>
                        <div class="full-content" style="display: none;">
                            <p>The museum offered a deep dive into the unique blend of Chinese, Malay, and Indonesian
                                influences that define Peranakan culture. Understanding the cultural symbols provided
                                valuable insights into their way of life and their relevance to a healthier community.

                                The symbols include brightly colored ornamental vases, plates, bowls, and more. From lime
                                green to bright pink porcelain, they were hard to miss and brightly displayed. A closer look
                                at the patterns they’re decorated with tells the story of the community’s emphasis on
                                aesthetic beauty and cultural identity.

                                Preserving Peranakan cultural practices can significantly contribute to a Healthier
                                Singapore by creating a sense of belonging and identity, which is important for mental
                                health and well-being. Engaging in traditional crafts and community events provides a sense
                                of purpose, especially for the elderly.

                                The next site visit offered an in-depth look into Singapore's history with a
                                thought-provoking exhibit on plastic waste in modern society. What stood out about the
                                Plastics Exhibit was the design of the space. It showed a modern bedroom, and as we walked
                                through, we observed the use of plastics and how seamlessly they fit into everyday life. We
                                also had the chance to learn more about the recyclability of these items through info cards.
                                I loved the simplicity of these cards as they allowed all visitors, even children, to
                                understand the seriousness of sustainability practices.

                                This focus on environmental impact highlights the need for promoting physical health by
                                advocating for a cleaner environment. By integrating cultural heritage and environmental
                                awareness, Singapore can adopt a holistic approach to health that includes mental,
                                emotional, and physical well-being.

                                The plastics exhibit’s focus on environmental impact also echoes Australia’s increasing
                                awareness and efforts towards sustainability. Both countries recognize the importance of
                                cultural preservation and the environment. Though the approaches and emphasis may vary, it
                                is a unified mission that we are both striving toward.

                                Overall, my visits to the Peranakan Museum and the National Museum's plastics exhibit
                                underscored the beauty of cultural traditions and the urgent need for environmental
                                sustainability. Understanding these practices not only enhances our cultural knowledge but
                                also highlights their role in promoting a healthy society. By valuing cultural heritage and
                                advocating for sustainable practices, we can contribute to a sustainable approach to public
                                health.

                        <h3>Reflection</h3>
                        <p>During my time on the Singapore/Malaysia tour, I helped out in various workshops and activities
                            that provided great insights into sustainable healthcare and cross-cultural design practices.
                            This experience has significantly shaped my understanding and approach to such topics.</p>
                        <div class="full-content" style="display: none;">
                            
                            <p>
                                The symposium was one of my favorite workshops, where we gathered to hear from highly
                                experienced experts in the field. The case studies, especially from our Taiwanese professor
                                and her redesign of the umbilical clamp, provided a detailed glimpse into the design process
                                across the industry, offering valuable pointers for my own design thinking. The site visits
                                to elder day care centers were also insightful, showing the approaches healthcare
                                professionals take towards sustainability. Activities, such as the Taylor University dinner
                                and the ugly t-shirt competition, helped me better engage with others outside my own
                                cultural context.

                                This tour highlighted that both Singapore and Malaysia are highly advanced, particularly in
                                their approach to aging populations. I would often observe elderly people actively cycling
                                or working out, reinforcing the emphasis on maintaining an active lifestyle. However, while
                                sustainability is reflected in policies, it is less ingrained in some areas of the culture,
                                especially concerning the relatively new practice of recycling, particularly single-use
                                plastics.

                                In the group, I contributed primarily through ideation, research, and wireframing. My
                                background in interaction design and design strategy helped maintain a solid line of design
                                thinking that included everyone's input. I went back on ideas to ensure alignment with our
                                personas, resulting in a refined campaign led by the visual communication designers. This
                                approach also helped with a smooth collaboration with other interaction design members,
                                overcoming language barriers.

                                One challenge was the group sometimes moving ahead with ideas that didn't align with our
                                personas or overlooked the skills of interaction design members. This was resolved through
                                open and honest communication, ensuring everyone’s contributions were valued.

                                Throughout my time in Singapore and Malaysia, I noticed the use of mascots to promote
                                behavior change, particularly on trains. We incorporated this cultural insight by creating
                                our own mascot, to resonate with the local culture, effectively conveying our message.

                                Having two nurses, Gabby and Xen, on our team provided significant insights, particularly on
                                wound care and its impact on sustainability. Their expertise guided our research, they
                                stressed the importance of this topic. The other design disciplines within our team allowed
                                us to create meaningful user experiences and beautiful visual assets. Furthermore this
                                project showed me that wound care is a global issue best addressed with cross-cultural
                                interpretations. Our easy-to-follow flowchart and culturally resonant mascot have the
                                potential to make a significant global impact.

                                Lastly, this experience has contributed immensely to my growth as a designer by exposing me
                                to other disciplines and their approaches. I plan to apply these insights by adopting a more
                                multidisciplinary and culturally informed approach in my future work, ensuring a holistic
                                and user-centric design process. My advice to future participants is to stay open-minded and
                                embrace the diversity of perspectives and disciplines. Engage actively in all activities,
                                communicate openly with your group, and use the cultural elements you observe to inform your
                                design decisions. This experience will greatly contribute to your personal and professional
                                growth.
